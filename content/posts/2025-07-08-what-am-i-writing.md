First post... It's weird considering the fact that I always wanted to write about random things to random people, but now that I've forced myself into this position, my mind has gone pretty blank. Must be something a lot of people feel when they first start off their blog.

Today marks my 23rd birthday. Back when I turned 20 I wrote a reoccurring calendar event on my phone titled "Your Beginning". It's a motivational note to myself that would spam as an alert on my phone whenever it was my birthday. I will not share the exact details of what I wrote to myself (it's too embarrassing), but here's some lines that sum it up pretty well:

- "On this day you decided to throw away your overwhelming humility. In place of it, a flame. A flame of arrogance, confidence, and dreaminess"

- "On the days following, I hope to still see you meticulously planning your every move, utilizing the nooks and crannies of tech to craft your dreams. We want to be an architect of the future, right?"

Looking at the messages I wrote, I can't help but look at what I wrote with the same feeling my mom must've felt when I told her I felt "mature". Words were one thing, but did I really think that just saying/writing things was really going to get me anywhere?

In the three years since, I'd say I've done pretty well for myself. I took on the challenge of leading a team of students to build an autonomous vehicle, growing the team from 5 to 80 people (job's not finished), I did a crazy number of internships, with one of them unexpectedly sending me to Tokyo for 8 months, exposing me to a whole different culture and lifestyle, and I took a whole month off to explore Japan/China with some close friends of mine from High School. No, I am not trying to tell you I am better, do not take it that way PLEASE. I'm just trying to say that after all that, I realized that words weren't the secret sauce to my adventurous life, getting out of my bed was.

So here I am, writing more words to introspect myself. Not just words this time, but a whole blog page to keep writing about myself for years to come. Why do I want to write so badly? 

Perhaps no matter how much I tell myself there's no point in writing my thoughts down, there exists an urge deep down in my unconscious to write. Only time will tell why I truly wanted to write a blog, but until then, I have some words for myself:

- You intend to document what you think, I hope that this blog will never evolve into anything other than that. 
- You are not a philosopher, and you have no right to tell others how they should think.
- Please please please stop with having your head in the clouds. Don't write about what you're about to do, just do it!!!

I hope that my future self will forever standby these principles. I do not want to become a know-it-all. I do not want to become narcissistic. And above all, I do not want to be chronically bed-ridden.

Funny enough, the first post being about me judging myself for writing in the first place sounds like the most cliche way to start off a blog. I guess no matter how much you want to be different, you will always converge back to the mean.
