Lately there's been a growing tension inside of me. Specifically, the tension between knowing my own path and feeling the sting when others don't see its value.

I delayed my graduation by a year to live in Japan. I put all my effort into propping up an Autonomous Vehicle team, giving me less time to Leetcode, less time to prepare for interviews, and less time to optimize myself for what the market wants. I see others my age getting into FAANG, and I think to myself: perhaps I've made the wrong choices over these past few years?

It's natural to think that way I guess. I'm human after all.

However, despite this, I always end up asking myself whether I regret anything that I did. And every time the answer is always no.

So let me answer my doubts once and for all. 

I chose to live in Japan because I knew the experience would shape me. I chose to revive an entire Autonomous Vehicle team, and continued to build a self-driving car from scratch NOT because it was the right career move, but because I wanted to build something bigger than myself.

These aren't misguided choices, they're the choices of someone who is living deliberately. Someone who chose depth over optimization.

Do I hope to prove my critics wrong someday? No way. My deepest satisfaction won't come from proving them wrong. It'll come from looking back at my 20s and knowing that I took on challenges that mattered, that I didn't shrink myself to fit someone else's scorecard, that I always took opportunities that called me.

So to anyone who tells me my choices are misguided, my answer to you is this: 

I took the scenic route :)
