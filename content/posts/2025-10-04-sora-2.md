Dead internet is coming... I wonder what we'll all do instead?

One interesting thing: Dead Internet Theory stems from the idea that there are secret organizational bodies coordinating a curated internet meant to brainwash the population. In reality, the real dead internet will come from a decentralized hivemind of people imagining up crazy scenarios for some useless reasons, brain-rotting the population instead.

Not a coordinated brainwash, but an uncoordinated brainrot, aha.
