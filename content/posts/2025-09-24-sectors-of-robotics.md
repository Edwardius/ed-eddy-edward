There are two types of robotics people. Those who believe Wall-E is just around the corner, and those who will tell you we're no where close.

They both have merit. 

One sees the the newest papers coming out of Gemini Robotics, or the latest models from OpenAI, and says, "Sooner or later these models are going to be in all our robots! They're going to fold our laundry, wash our dishes, make food... The future is here!", forgetting that it takes time to deploy robots to consumers -- that just showing results is only 30% of the way there and the rest is about making it repeatable. The result, a unicorn startup turned into history's biggest fraud case.

Meanwhile, the other sees the graveyard of robotic startups and the empty wallets of irresponsible VCs, and says, "Wake up. Robots aren't going to take over our lives anytime soon. They still struggle with driving on highways, talking to humans, and climbing stairs!", forgetting that there are dozens of very smart, competent people working to solve these struggles day-in-day-out -- that everyday there's always a chance that all of sudden they go from pragmatic realists to forgotten veterans being left behind.
